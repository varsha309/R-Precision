# R-Precision
A R-Precision evaluation module for AttnGAN based model, using the procedure outlined in the paper [AttnGAN: Fine-Grained Text to Image Generation with Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Xu_AttnGAN_Fine-Grained_Text_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf) by Tao Xu and others. The module calculates the R-Precision score using a special data directory called RPData. This dataset can be generated from evaluated checkpoint directory using [build_RPdata.py](https://github.com/maincarry/R-Precision/blob/master/build_RPData.py).

## Note
Although this evaluation model uses the same procedure in the AttnGAN paper to calculate the score, we use the result from model evaluation as input, rather than the randomly generated samples from the paper (see below). The discrepancy may produce slightly lower scores than those in the paper, but the result are consistant.

|Input Data| How we get the data | How the paper gets the data
|--|--|--|
| Captions (Real) | all captions in test set*| randomly sampled from test set
| Captions (Fake) | randomly sampled from train+test set | randomly sampled from test set

\* Depends on evaluation setting. For accurate result, all captions (10 per image) must be evaluated to produce ~29330 samples on CUB-2011 dataset. 

## Requirement
The script is written in Python 3. However, with little modification, running with Python 2 is also possible.

The image encoder and text encoder follows the same format as AttnGAN. Modify the model structure as necessary.

## How to use
Paste **eval_RP.py** into your model code directory. It requires model.py and miscc/config.py.

To evaluate the RP score for a certain checkpoint:
- Evaluate the checkpoint. AttnGAN example:
`python3 train.py --gpu 0 --cfg cfg/eval_bird.yml`

**Make sure all captions (10 per image) are evaluated for accurate result. E.g. Should have 29330 images for CUB-2011 Dataset**

- Use build_RPData.py to build RPData directory from evaluated images
`python3 build_RPData.py /netG_epoch_xxx/valid/single -t /dataset/birds/text`

*You may need to change build_RPData.py to fit your naming pattern.*
- Use eval_RP to evaluate the RP score
`python3 eval_RP.py ./RP_DATA -c /dataset/birds/captions.pickle`
